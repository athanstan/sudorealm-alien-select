# Things you could do

If you want to contribute but do not know where to start, this list provides some starting points.

- Add needed functionality that you might need and is not supported.
- Improve the ReadMe
- Fix any Security issues

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - If you love testing, and you want to see a better, more tested world, then you can do that here!

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding and thank you ðŸ¥³**!
